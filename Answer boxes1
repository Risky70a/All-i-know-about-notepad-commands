#dont include this
in row 2 is where you can edit
the text in the answer box
1: is the box text
2: is the button type make sure you use "4"
3: is the box title

in row 5 you can edit the response
replace the "yes" with your text remember
you need to keep the quotation mark
in row 7 is the same just if you press no

in row 4 you can edit what you want your respomse 5
should be for example: vbabort so if i have the button number "2"
it will only say "yes" if i press abort but if i press any other button it will say "no"

And BTW in msgbox you can also do this (Msgbox("text","2","title")
in row 5 and 7
