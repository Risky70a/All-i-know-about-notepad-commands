# All-i-know-about-notepad-commands
Im only doing this cause some times its hard to find on the internet dont worry my files are safe its ok if you dont trust me but thats not my problem anyways i only update when i find something new im also putting a tutorial how to set the command/Code up and how to activate it Btw you dont need a special name while saving it but you always need to put .vbs or .bat at the end of your title 

This works windows 8 all the to windows 11
